## üîß Installation

It's recommended to use `uv` to manage the Python environment and dependencies.

1.  üîë **Obtain a Google Gemini API Key:**
    Go to [Google AI Studio](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey) to create your API key.

2.  üìÑ **Set up Environment Variables:**
    Copy the `.env.tpl` file and rename it to `.env`:
    ```bash
    copy .env.tpl .env
    ```
    Then, edit the `.env` file and fill in the `GOOGLE_API_KEY` field with your API key.

3.  üõ†Ô∏è **Install uv:**
    *   **Recommended (Cross-Platform):** Refer to the [uv official documentation](https://github.com/astral-sh/uv#installation) for installation instructions.
    *   **Windows (using Chocolatey):**
        ```bash
        choco install -y uv
        ```

4.  üì¶ **Sync Dependencies:**
    Run the following command in the project root directory. `uv` will read `pyproject.toml` (or `requirements.txt`) and install the required packages:
    ```bash
    uv sync
    ```

## üöÄ Usage

### üåç Translate Text Files

This feature can translate text files into multiple languages (e.g., English `en`, Simplified Chinese `zh-CN`) and generate corresponding language-specific output files (e.g., `README_en.md`, `README_zh-CN.md`).

> [!NOTE]
> Currently, the translation is done by reading the entire file at once, so there might be issues if the file contains too much text!

The command format is as follows:

```bash
uv run src/i18n_tool.py --name <filename> [--lang <language1,language2,...>]
```

Example:

```bash
uv run src/i18n_tool.py --name README.md --lang en
```

> [!NOTE]
> The current model being used is `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`. Initial tests show that while this model is slightly slower than `2.0 Flash` in terms of translation speed, it has reasoning capabilities and is the latest version. Considering that the `README.md` file is not large, the translation time is not too long, so this model was chosen for initial testing and development.
> For simple translations using `gemini-2.5-flash-preview-04-17`, you can set `thinking_budget=0` to disable the deep thinking mode.

### üåç Translate `.properties` Files

This feature can translate `.properties` files into multiple languages (e.g., English `en`, Simplified Chinese `zh-CN`) and generate corresponding language-specific output files (e.g., `test_en.properties`, `test_zh-CN.properties`).

The command format is as follows:

```bash
uv run src/i18n_props.py --name <filename> [--unicode] [--output-dir DIR] [--lang LANG1,LANG2,...]
```

Example: To translate `test.properties` to `English` and `without Unicode encoding`:

```bash
uv run src/i18n_props.py --name test --lang en
```

> [!NOTE]
> `.properties` files often contain a large amount of text content. It is recommended to use the `gemini-2.0-flash` model to improve translation efficiency and stability.
